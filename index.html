  <h2>Functional Programming Overview</h2>
  <h3>Pure Functions</h3>
  <p>At the heart of functional programming is the formal mathematics of describing logic:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>
    . Mathematicians like to describe programs as transformations of data which leads to the first concept — 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>
    . Pure functions are functions without
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">side-effects</a>
    .
    <strong>Pure functions depend only on the inputs of the function, and the output should be the exact same for the same input.</strong> Here's an example:
  </p>
  <pre>
		<strong>// pure function</strong><br>const add10 = (a) =&gt; a + 10
	</pre>
  <pre>
		<strong>// impure function due to external non-constants<br></strong>let x = 10<br>const addx = (a) =&gt; a + x
	</pre>
  <pre>
		<strong>// also impure due to side-effect<br></strong>const setx = (v) =&gt; x = v
	</pre>
  <p>The impure function indirectly depends on
    <em>x</em>. If you were to change
    <em>x</em>, then
    <em>addx</em> would output a different value for the same inputs. This makes it hard
    to statically analyze and optimize programs at compile-time. But more pragmatically for JavaScript developers,
    <strong>pure functions bound the cognitive load of programming</strong>.
    When you're writing a pure function, you only need to concern yourself with the body of the function. You don't need
    to worry about externalises that could cause problems, like anything that could change
    <em>x</em> while when you're writing the
    <em>addx</em> function.</p>
  <h3>Function Composition</h3>
  <p>One nice thing about pure functions is that you can
    <em>compose</em> them into new functions. One special operator used to describe
    programs in lambda calculus is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition" target="_blank"><em>compose</em></a>
    . Compose takes two functions and “composes” them into a new function. Check it out:
  </p>
  <pre>const add1 = (a) =&gt; a + 1<br>const times2 = (a) =&gt; a * 2<br>const compose = (a, b) =&gt; (c) =&gt; a(b(c))<br>const add1OfTimes2 = compose(add1, times2)<br>add1OfTimes2(5) // =&gt; 11
	</pre>
  <p>The
    <em>compose</em> is analogous to the preposition “of”. Notice the order of the
    arguments and how they're evaluated: add one
    <em>of</em> times two — the second function is evaluated first. Compose is the
    opposite of perhaps a more intuitive function you might be familiar with from unix called
    <em>pipe</em>, which accepts an array of functions.</p>
  <pre>const pipe = (fns) =&gt; (x) =&gt; fns.reduce((v, f) =&gt; f(v), x)<br>const times2add1 = pipe([times2, add1])<br>times2add1(5) // =&gt; 11
	</pre>
  <p>With function composition, we can now build more
    complicated data transformations by joining together (composing) smaller functions.
    <a href="http://fr.umio.us/why-ramda/">This article</a>
    does a great job of showing you how function composition can help you process data in a clean and concise way.
  </p>
  <p>Pragmatically speaking,
    <strong>composition is a
      <em>better</em> alternative to object oriented inheritance</strong>. Here's a
    contrived, but real-world example for you. Suppose you need to create a greeting for your users.
  </p>
  <pre>const greeting = (name) =&gt; `Hello ${name}`</pre>
  <p>Great! A simple, pure function. Then, your project
    manager says you now have some more data about your users and wants you to add prefixes to the names. So you go
    ahead and write this code:</p>
  <pre>const greeting = (name, male=false, female=false) =&gt;<br> `Hello ${male ? ‘Mr. ‘ : female ? ‘Ms. ‘ : ‘'} ${name}`
	</pre>
  <p>This code isn't terrible, but what if we start adding
    more and more booleans for other categories such as “Dr.” or “Sir”? What if we add suffixes as well such as “MD” or
    “PhD”? And what if we want to have a casual greeting that says “Sup” instead of “Hello”? Well now things have really
    gotten out of hand.</p>
  <p>Adding booleans like this to a function isn't exactly
    object oriented inheritance, but its a similar situation to when objects have properties and methods that get
    extended and overridden as they inherit. So as opposed to adding boolean options, lets try to use function
    composition:</p>
  <pre>const formalGreeting = (name) =&gt; `Hello ${name}`<br>const casualGreeting = (name) =&gt; `Sup ${name}`<br>const male = (name) =&gt; `Mr. ${name}`<br>const female = (name) =&gt; `Mrs. ${name}`<br>const doctor = (name) =&gt; `Dr. ${name}`<br>const phd = (name) =&gt; `${name} PhD`<br>const md = (name) =&gt; `${name} M.D.`
	</pre>
  
  <p>This is much more manageable and easier to reason about.
    Each function does a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">one simple thin</a>
    g and we're able to compose them together easily. Now, we haven't handled all the cases here, and for that we can
    use our handy pipe function!
  </p>
  <pre>const identity = (x) =&gt; x<br>const greet = (name, options) =&gt; {<br> return pipe([<br>
		<strong>// greeting</strong>
		<br> options.formal ? formalGreeting :<br> casualGreeting,<br>
		<strong>// prefix</strong><br> options.doctor ? doctor :<br> options.male ? male :<br> options.female ? female :<br> identity,<br>
		<strong>// suffix</strong><br> options.phd ? phd :<br> options.md ?md :<br> identity<br> ])(name)<br>}
	</pre>
  <p>Using pure functions and function composition simplifies
    error tracing.
    <span>When an error is thrown, the stack trace shows through every function down to the source of the exception. Often, in an OOP stack-trace, you can't view the state of the object which led to the bug.</span>
  </p>
  <h3>Function Currying</h3>
  <p>Function currying was invented by the same guy who
    invented Haskell — his name:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry">Haskell Curry</a>
    (correction: named after Haskell Curry). Function currying is when you call a function with fewer arguments than it
    wants and that function returns another function to accept the rest of the arguments.
    <a href="https://hughfdjackson.com/javascript/why-curry-helps/" target="_blank">This is a good article that explains</a>
    it in more detail, but here's a simple example using the
    <a href="http://ramdajs.com/0.19.1/docs/#curry">Ramda.js curry function</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>In the example below, we create a curried function “add”,
    which takes in two arguments. When we pass one argument, we get back a partially applied function we call “add1”
    which only takes one argument.</p>
  <pre>const add = R.curry((a, b) =&gt; a + b)<br>add(1, 2) // =&gt; 3<br>const add1 = add(1)<br>add1(2) // =&gt; 3<br>add1(10) // =&gt; 11
	</pre>
  <p>In Haskell, all functions are automatically curried.
    There are no optional or default arguments.</p>
  <p>Pragmatically, function currying is really convenient when
    using functions with
    <em>compose</em> and
    <em>pipe. </em>For example:</p>
  <pre>const users = [{name: 'chet', age:25}, {name:'joe', age:24}]<br>R.pipe(<br> R.sortBy(R.prop('age')),
		<strong>// sort user by the age property</strong><br> R.map(R.prop('name')),
		<strong>// get each name property</strong><br> R.join(', '),
		<strong>// join the names with a comma</strong><br>)(users)<br>
	</pre>
  <p>This makes data processing feel very declarative.</p>
  <h3>Monads, Functors, and Fancy&nbsp;Words</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29" target="_blank">Monads</a>
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor">functors</a>
    <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html">read this article</a>
  </p>
  <p>Monads are pretty interesting though. Monads can be
    thought of as a container for a value, and to open up the container and do something to the value, you need to
    <em>map</em> over it. Here's a simple example:</p>
  <pre>
		<strong>// monad</strong><br>list = [-1,0,1]<br>list.map(inc) // =&gt; [0,1,2]<br>list.map(isZero) // =&gt; [false, true, false]
	</pre>
  <p>The important thing about monads and functors is that
    mathematicians have been researching these ideas in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>
    . This provides us not only a framework for understanding programs, but
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28category_theory%29#Algebras_for_a_monad">algebraic theorems and proofs</a>
    we can use to statically analyze and optimize our code when it's compiled. This is one of the main benefits of
    Haskell — the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler" target="_blank">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a>
    is a feat of human ingenuity.
  </p>
  <p>There are all kinds of theorems and identities expressed
    in category theory. For example, here's a simple identity:</p>
  <pre>list.map(inc).map(isZero) // =&gt; [true, false, false]<br>list.map(compose(isZero, inc)) // =&gt; [true, false, false]
	</pre>
  <p>When
    <em>map</em> is compiled, it uses an efficient while loop. In general this is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory" target="_blank">O(n) operation (linear time)</a>
    , but there is still overhead associated with incrementing the pointer to the next item in the list. So the second
    version is actually twice as performant. These are the kind of transformations that Haskell does to your code at
    compile-time to make it fast — and there's a really cool trick to doing this that I'll explain later.
  </p>
  <p>To expand on monads just a little, there's a very
    interesting monad called the
    <em>Maybe</em> monad (sometimes called
    <em>Option</em> or
    <em>Optional</em> in Swift). In Haskell, there's no such thing as
    <em>null</em> or
    <em>undefined</em>. To express something as being potentially
    <em>null</em>, you need to wrap it in a monad so the Haskell compiler knows what to
    do with it.
  </p>
  <p>The
    <em>Maybe</em> monad is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type">union type</a>
    that's either <em>Nothing</em> or
    <em>Just something</em>. In Haskell you'd define a
    <em>Maybe </em>like this:
  </p>
  <pre>type Maybe = Nothing | Just x</pre>
  <p>The lowercase
    <em>x</em> just means any other type.</p>
  <p>Being a monad, you can&nbsp;.<em>map()</em> over a
    <em>Maybe</em> to change the value it contains! When you map over a
    <em>Maybe</em>, if it of type
    <em>Just</em>, then we apply the function to the value and returns a new
    <em>Just</em> with that new value. If a the
    <em>Maybe</em> is of type
    <em>Nothing</em>, then we return
    <em>Nothing</em>. In Haskell, the syntax is quite elegant and uses pattern matching,
    but in JavaScript you might use a
    <em>Maybe </em>like this:</p>
  <pre>const x = Maybe.Just(10)<br>const n = x.map(inc)<br>n.isJust() // true<br>n.value() // 11
	</pre>
  <pre>const x= Maybe.Nothing<br>const n = x.map(inc) // no error!<br>n.isNothing // true
	</pre>
  <p>This monad may not seem terribly useful in your
    Javascript code, but its interesting to see why it's so useful in Haskell.
    <strong>Haskell requires you to define what to do in every edge-case of your
      program, otherwise it won't compile.</strong> When you make an HTTP request, you get back a
    <em>Maybe</em> type because the request may fail and return nothing. And if you
    didn't handle the case in which the request failed, then your program won't compile. This basically means that it's
    impossible to get runtime errors. Maybe your code does the wrong thing, but it doesn't just magically break like
    things tend to do in Javascript.
  </p>
  <blockquote>This is a big selling point for using
    Elm. The type system and compiler enforces that your program will run without runtime errors.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thinking about code in the context of monads and
    algebraic structures will help you define and understand your problem in a structured way. For example, an
    interesting extension of 
    <em>Maybe</em> is the
    <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/">Railway-Oriented Programming</a>
    concept for error handling. And
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE692Clb5LU">observable streams</a>
    are monads as well for dealing with asynchronous events.
  </p>
  <p>There are all kinds of fancy monads and many other words
    that I don't myself fully understand. But to keep all the lingo consistent, there are specifications like
    <a href="https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land">fantasy-land</a>
    and the
    <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">typeclassopedia</a>
    which try to unify different concepts in category theory for the purpose of writing idiomatic functional code.
  </p>
  <h3>Referential Transparency and Immutability</h3>
  <p>Another implication of leveraging all this category
    theory and lambda calculus stuff is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency" target="_blank">referential transparency</a>
    . Its really hard for mathematicians to analyze logical programs when
    <em>two things that are the same are not equal to each other.</em> This is an issue
    all over the place in Javascript.
  </p>
  <pre>{} == {} // false<br>[] == [] // false<br>[1,2] == [1,2] // false
	</pre>
  <p>Now imagine having to do math in a world without
    referential transparency. You would not be able to write proofs that say that an empty array is the same things as an empty array. What should matter is only the
    <em>value</em> of the array, not the reference pointer to the array. And so
    functional programming languages resort to using deep-equals to compare values. But this isn't terribly performant,
    so there are some neat tricks to make this comparison quicker that leverages references.
  </p>
  <p>Before moving on, I just want to make one thing clear: in
    functional programming, you cannot mutate a variable without changing its reference. Otherwise, the function
    performing the mutation would be impure! Thus, you can assure that if two variables are referentially equal, their
    values must be equal as well. And since we can't mutate variables in-place, then we have to copy those values into a
    new memory location every time we want to transform it. This is a huge performance loss and results in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">garbage thrashing</a>
    . But the solution is using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure" target="_blank">structural sharing (persistent data structures)</a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>A simple example of structural sharing is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a>
    . Suppose you only keep a reference to the end of the list. When comparing two lists, you can first start by seeing
    if the ends are referentially equal. This is a nice shortcut because if they are equal, then you're done — the two
    lists are the same! Otherwise, you'll have to start iterating through the items in each list to see if their values
    are equal. To efficiently add a value to this list, rather than copying entire the list into a new set of memory,
    you can simply add a link to a new node and keep track of the reference at the new tip. Thus, we've structurally
    shared the previous data structure in a new data structure with a new reference and we've persisted the previous
    data structure as well.
  </p>
  <p>The generalized data structure for doing these immutable
    data transformations is called a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie" target="_blank">hash array mapped trie</a>
    (HAMT). This is exactly what
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable.js</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/mori">Mori.js</a>
    do. Both Clojurescript and Haskell have this built into the compiler, although I'm not sure it's implemented in Elm
    yet.
  </p>
  <p>Using immutable data structures can give you performance
    gains, and help keep your sanity.
    <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>
    assumes <em>props</em> and
    <em>state</em> are always immutable so it can do an efficient check to see if the
    previous
    <em>props</em> and
    <em>state</em> are referentially equal to the next
    <em>props</em> and
    <em>state</em> before unnecessarily re-rendering. And in other circumstance, using
    immutable data simply helps to ensure that values aren't changing without you realizing it.
  </p>
  <h3>Lazy Evaluation</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">Lazy evaluation</a>
    is a general term that covers concepts like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunks</a>
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_programming%29">generators</a>
    . Lazy evaluation means: don't do something until you have to, be lazy and procrastinate as long as possible.
  </p>
  <p>First, we need to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy" target="_blank">how programs evaluate</a>. 
    Pretty much every language you're used to uses <em>innermost reduction</em>.
    Innermost reduction looks like this:
  </p>
  <pre>square(3 + 4)<br>square(7) // evaluated the innermost expression<br>7 * 7<br>49
	</pre>
  <p>This is a sane and reasonable way of evaluating
    programs. But now, let's consider outermost reduction:</p>
  <pre>square(3 + 4)<br>(3 + 4) * (3 + 4) // evaluated the outermost expression<br>7 * (3 + 4)<br>7 * 7<br>49
	</pre>
  <p>Outermost is clearly less efficient — we've had to
    compute 3 + 4 twice, so the program took 5 steps instead of 4. This is no good. But
    <strong>Haskell keeps a reference to each expression and shares these
      references as they're passed down to parent expressions through the outermost reduction.</strong> Thus, when 3 + 4
    is evaluated the first time, the reference to this expression now points to the expression, 7. Thus we get to skip
    the duplicate step.
  </p>
  <pre>square(3 + 4)<br>(3 + 4) * (3 + 4) // evaluated the outermost expression<br>7 * 7 // both reduced at the same time due to reference sharing<br>49
	</pre>
  <blockquote>Fundamentally, lazy evaluation is
    outermost evaluation with reference sharing.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Haskell does all this stuff under the hood for
    you, and what that means is you can define things like infinite lists. For example, you can recursively define an
    infinite list of ones as 1 joined with itself.</p>
  <pre>ones = 1 : ones</pre>
  <p>Suppose you have a function
    <em>take(n, list) </em>which takes the first n elements of a list. If we used
    innermost reduction, we'd recursively evaluate list forever, because it's infinite. But instead, with outermost
    reduction, we lazily evaluate ones for just as many ones as we need!
  </p>
  <p>However, since JavaScript and most other programming
    languages use innermost reduction, the only way we can replicate these constructs is by treating arrays as
    functions. For example:</p>
  <pre>const makeOnes = () =&gt; {next: () =&gt; 1}<br>ones = makeOnes()<br>ones.next() // =&gt; 1<br>ones.next() // =&gt; 1</pre>
  <p>Now we've effectively created a lazily evaluated
    infinite list based on the same recursive definition. Lets create an infinite list of natural numbers:</p>
  <pre>const makeNumbers = () =&gt; {<br> let n = 0<br> return {next: () =&gt; {<br> n += 1<br> return n<br> }<br>}<br>numbers = makeNumbers()<br>numbers.next() // 1<br>numbers.next() // 2<br>numbers.next() // 3
	</pre>
  <p>In ES2015, there's actually a standard for this and they're called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_generator" target="_blank">function generators</a>
    .
  </p>
  <pre name="0c5b" id="0c5b">function* numbers() {<br> let n = 0<br> while(true) {<br> n += 1<br> yield n
		<br> }<br>}
	</pre>
