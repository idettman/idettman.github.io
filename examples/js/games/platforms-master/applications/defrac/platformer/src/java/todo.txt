/**
 * 'Platformer' is a defrac project to render tmx maps built with Tiled.

 * It is a fun-project for which I do not have the time to ensure a rock solid development.
 * The goal is however to write a super-mario like jump'n'run game,
 * cause I still love that way more than all the fancy 3d-games.
 * The rendering is entirely done in GL (with a minimal number of draw calls).
 * Performance notes:
 * Do not use transparent tiles. Just leave them empty in Tiled.
 * Use as few as possible different tilesets. Each switch will cause a draw call to the GPU.
 * Notes:
 * Defrac enables this project to run in IOS, Android, HTML and natively!
 * Make sure you have java 1.8 installed.
 * TODO-LIST
 * [X] Load and parse tmx-format
 * [X] Render tiles on createScreen
 * [X] Render layers with opacity
 * [X] Render animations
 * [X] Support tile-flipping (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
 * [X] Draw objects by GL (for debugging, will not be optimised)
 * [X] Implement polygon (closed)
 * [X] Find the correct offset(x,y) for tilesets that are not the same tile-size as the map tile-size (render-ordering?)
 * [X] Implement map background color (waiting for a defrac update which allows to decode web colors e.g. #FFF)
 * [X] Add sprite support within rendering (z-Sorting)
 * [X] Optimise animation lookup > too much GC waste in java.util.HashMap
 * [ ] Remove transparent color (shader or boot)
 * [ ] Implement all possible render orderings
 * [ ] Implement all possible orientations
 * [ ] Implement Image Collection
 * [ ] Add Image-Layer support
 * [ ] Implement margin, spacing for tilesets (need test-files)
 * [ ] Implement rotation of objects
 * [ ] Implement draworder of objects
 * [ ] Expose all meta tmx properties of objects
 * [ ] Convert tmx format to a more common and accessible structure to allow different map formats
 * [ ] Implement Physics
