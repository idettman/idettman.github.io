  // recent note: While I'm flattered that this answer has gotten many upvotes, I am also somewhat horrified. If one needs to convert dot-notation strings like "x.a.b.c" into references, it's probably a sign that there is something very wrong going on (unless maybe you're performing some strange deserialization). It is overkill because it is unnecessary metaprogramming, and also somewhat violates functional side-effect-free coding style. Also, expect massive performance hits as well if you do this more than you need to (e.g. as your app's default form of passing objects around and dereferencing them). If for some reason this is server-side js, the usual holds for sanitization of inputs. Novices who find their way to this answer should consider working with array representations instead, e.g. ['x','a','b','c'], or even something more direct/simple/straightforward if possible, like not losing track of the references themselves, or maybe some pre-existing unique id, etc.
  //   Here's an elegant one-liner that's 10x shorter than the other solutions:
  function index (obj, i) {return obj[i]}

  'a.b.etc'.split('.').reduce(index, obj)

  // Or in ECMAScript 6:
  'a.b.etc'.split('.').reduce((o, i) => o[i], obj)

  // In response to those who still are afraid of using reduce despite it being in the ECMA-262 standard (5th edition), here is a two-line recursive implementation:
  function multiIndex (obj, is) {  // obj,['1','2','3'] -> ((obj['1'])['2'])['3']
    return is.length ? multiIndex(obj[is[0]], is.slice(1)) : obj
  }

  function pathIndex (obj, is) {   // obj,'1.2.3' -> multiIndex(obj,['1','2','3'])
    return multiIndex(obj, is.split('.'))
  }

  pathIndex('a.b.etc')

  // BETTER VERSION
  function checkNested (obj, level, ...rest) {
    if (obj === undefined) {
      return false
    }
    if (rest.length == 0 && obj.hasOwnProperty(level)) {
      return true
    }
    return checkNested(obj[level], ...rest)
  }

  // OLD VERSION

  function checkNested (obj /*, level1, level2, ... levelN*/) {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);

    for (var i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
      if (!obj || !obj.hasOwnProperty(args[i])) {
        return false;
      }
      obj = obj[args[i]];
    }
    return true;
  }

  var test = {level1: {level2: {level3: 'level3'}}};

  checkNested(test, 'level1', 'level2', 'level3'); // true
  checkNested(test, 'level1', 'level2', 'foo'); // false
