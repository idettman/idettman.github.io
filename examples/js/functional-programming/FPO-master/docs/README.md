# FPO.js Docs

* See [Core API](core-API.md) for documentation on all the methods in the `FPO.*` namespace.
* See [Standard API](std-API.md) for documenation on the methods in the `FPO.std.*` namespace.

	All core methods have a standard positional-parameter form available under the `FPO.std.*` namespace. In many respects, their conceptual behavior is the same, but in some cases there's some differences to be aware of.

	There are also a few methods on the `FPO.std.*` namespace that have no equivalent in the core API as they are unnecessary or don't make sense.
