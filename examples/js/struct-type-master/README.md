A restricted Struct type for JavaScript.


## Example

```js
const struct = require('struct-type');
const t = struct.types;

const Point2d = struct('Point2d', {
  x: t.Any,
  y: t.Any
});

// Make new instances with `.make`
const p1 = Point2d.make({ x: 1, y: 2 });
const p2 = Point2d.make({ x: 2, y: 2 });

// Update fields with `set<Field>`. 
// This constructs a new prototype-based shallow copy (with Object.create):
const p1_2 = p1.setX(2);
p1;   // ==> { x: 1, y: 2 }
p1_2; // ==> { x: 2, __proto__: p1 }

// Flatten structs into regular objects to pass to APIs expecting regular JS objects:
p1_2.toObject();
// ==> { x: 2, y: 2, __proto__: null }

// Each struct gets its own type function:
const Line = struct('Line', {
  start: Point2d.type,
  end: Point2d.type
});

const line = Line.make({ start: p1, end: p2 });
```

## Installation

The officially supported way of getting struct-type is through [npm][]:

    $ npm install struct-type

> **NOTE**
>
> If you don't have npm, you'll need to install [Node.js][] in your
> system before installing struct-type.

A tool like [Browserify][] or [Webpack][] can be used to run struct-type in
platforms that don't implement Node-style modules, like the Browser.

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com
[Browserify]: http://browserify.org/
[Webpack]: https://webpack.github.io/


## Supported platforms

struct-type is supported in all platforms that support ECMAScript 5.


> **NOTE**  
> For platforms that don't support ECMAScript 5, (like IE8 and 9) the
> [es5-shim][] library can be used to provide the additional runtime
> support.
