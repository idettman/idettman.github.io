**What is an example?**

A very simple scene showing possible use cases of some feature of the engine.

**Any guidelines?**

+ Fully comment the sources - the main purpose of these examples is to serve as documentation.
+ Don't use too many external libraries
+ Don't use V.js - it does a lot more than you need for a simple example; it also hides a lot from the user and they would eventually start using V themselves which is not what we want
