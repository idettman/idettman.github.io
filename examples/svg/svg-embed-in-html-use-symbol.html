SVG is well supported in IE 9 and up, and all modern browsers, 
as well as Opera Mini (new development! (https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-mini-server-upgrade/)).

Fallbacks #
I implement a simple feature text inline in the <head> . 
  This adds an .svg class to the <html> element, 
which you can use to add fallback content.


Add the contents of your sprite to the markup in a hidden container.
<div hidden>
  <svg>...</svg>
</div>

CSS properties for SVG element
display: inline-block;
fill: currentColor;
height: 0;
width: 0;


/**
* Display icons when browser supports SVG.
* Inherit height, width, and color.
*/
.svg .icon { height: 1em; width: 1em; }

To use an icon, simply reference its ID using the <use> element.
<svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="#icon-logo"></use></svg>
  
  I’ve also found that inlining the sprite results in faster peceived performance.
  
  While external svg files will gain you some browser caching benefits, 
  I’ve found that perceived load times are better using the inlined sprite approach, 
  as the icons are rendered immediately.
