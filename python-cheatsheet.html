<dl>
  <dt>trinary operator, like in JS (condition) ? branchA : branchB</dt>
  <dd>a if condition else b</dd>
  <dt>To loop every key and value from a dictionary – for k, v in dict.items():</dt>
</dl>

First condition is evaluated, then exactly one of either a or b is evaluated and returned based on the Boolean value of condition. 
If condition evaluates to True, then a is evaluated and returned but b is ignored, or else when b is evaluated and returned but a is ignored.

This allows short-circuiting because when condition is true only a is evaluated and b is not evaluated at all, 
but when condition is false only b is evaluated and a is not evaluated at all.

<div>For example:</div>
<code>
>>> 'true' if True else 'false'
'true'
>>> 'true' if False else 'false'
'false'
</code>
Note that conditionals are an expression, not a statement. This means you can't use assignment statements or pass or other statements within a conditional expression:

<code>
>>> pass if False else x = 3
File "<stdin>", line 1
  pass if False else x = 3
  ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
  In such a case, you have to use a normal if statement instead of a conditional expression.

  Keep in mind that it's frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:

  The order of the arguments is different from those of the classic condition ? a : b ternary operator from many other languages (such as C, C++, Go, Perl, Ruby, Java, Javascript, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python's "surprising" behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).
  Some find it "unwieldy", since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).
  Stylistic reasons.
  If you're having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, x = 4 if b > 8 else 9 is read aloud as x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9.

  Is there an equivalent of C’s ”?:” ternary operator?

  The order may seems strange for coders however f(x) = |x| = x if x > 0 else -x sounds very natural to mathematicians. You may also understand it as do A in most case, except when C then you should do B instead... – yota Jan 25 '16 at 15:07

  Be careful with order of operations when using this. For example, the line z = 3 + x if x < y else y. If x=2 and y=1, you might expect that to yield 4, but it would actually yield 1. z = 3 + (x if x > y else y) is the correct usage. – Kal Zekdor Mar 6 '16 at 9:23

  The point was if you want to perform additional evaluations after the conditional is evaluated, like adding a value to the result, you'll either need to add the additional expression to both sides (z = 3 + x if x < y else 3 + y), or group the conditional (z = 3 + (x if x < y else y) or z = (x if x < y else y) + 3) – Kal Zekdor Apr 15 '16 at 0:36

  I love the vague irony of this syntactic ordering being described as natural by someone called @yota. – nickf Dec 20 '16 at 21:25

  You can index into a tuple:

  (falseValue, trueValue)[test]
  test needs to return True or False.
  It might be safer to always implement it as:

  (falseValue, trueValue)[test == True]
  or you can use the built-in bool() to assure a Boolean value:

  (falseValue, trueValue)[bool(<expression>)]

    Note that this one always evaluates everything, whereas the if/else construct only evaluates the winning expression. – SilverbackNet Feb 4 '11 at 2:25

    (lambda: print("a"), lambda: print("b"))[test==true]() – Dustin Getz Mar 8 '12 at 19:31

    It should be noted that what's within the []s can be an arbitrary expression. Also, for safety you can explicitly test for truthiness by writing [bool(<expression>)]. The bool() function has been around since v2.2.1. – martineau May 31 '12 at 18:20

      This is great for code-golf, not so much for actual code. Although I have gotten so used to it that I do use it sometimes for conciseness when doing something obvious like picking between two string constants. – Claudiu Dec 5 '14 at 17:52

      I've done a similar trick -- only once or twice, but done it -- by indexing into a dictionary with True and False as the keys: {True:trueValue, False:falseValue}[test] I don't know whether this is any less efficient, but it does at least avoid the whole "elegant" vs. "ugly" debate. There's no ambiguity that you're dealing with a boolean rather than an int. – JDM Mar 1 '16 at 18:43
